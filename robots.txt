In my head raging thunderstorms
(So) what are you waiting (looking) for
Bland and crushed bullshit roses
Lie (Scattered) across the floor

Raised them all as daughters
Feeding them love and vomit
Snot is dripping (all) over
Making me over so...

You probably think I'm sick
I really feel unwell
Under my skin
I grow the virus / (So it could love me as I am) It loves me as I am

Your heart is broken
But Heathcliff didn't do it
From the south came a (the) storm
That washed his body over
