About A Robots

In my head raging thunderstorms
So what can you nothing more
Its crumpled bullshit roses
Throw under your forgot

I raised them like daughters
Nourishing self love and vomit
Panting from his snot
I try to not look so

You probably think I'm sick
I really feel unwell
Under its your skin
I grow the virus, so he can love me such what I am

Your heart is broken 
But Heathcliff has nothing to do with
His body blurred a long time
Storm that from the South came to us
