Well, our alco party has begun
You're so fucking pretty, my girlfriend
Everybody dancing through the night
Come and join us on the dancing floor

Well, our alco party has begun
This is just beginning, not the end
Well, our alco party has begun
Kick it up and trade it all in for fun

Aey aey aey aey I am drunk all the time
Aey aey aey aey I was drunk all the time
Aey aey aey aey I was drunk all the time
Aey aey aey aey I was drunk all the time

Now the wedding ceremony begins 
Everybody's getting pissed again
The bride's dress is torn and she is crying
It's fine (No biggie), sweetheart, just drink wine
