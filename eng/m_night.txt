I know you and we're happy in an ocean
You know you leave me floating in happy emotions 
Diving deep in the slime of the jellyfish ribbons
Heating lies in disguise, all the passion I snivel

Oh, tell me why?
We're buried when we die
Never thought to say goodbye
And now that I try...

Close the door, sit on floor and don't look back
All your dreams aren't free , that's a fact
You're so quiet, pain inside eats my brain
Run from trees that you see on your way
