All the scream and dancing all night
And you dance until you're tired

Aey aey aey aey I am drunk an all the time
Aey aey aey aey I was drunk an all the time
Aey aey aey aey I was drunk an all the time

in a drunken stupor fly again
The bride's dress was torn, she’s a cry
Nothing sweetheart, just drink wine

Our alco party is begin
This is only starting not the end
Our alño party Is begin

Aey aey aey aey I was drunk an all the time
Aey aey aey aey I was drunk an all the time
Aey aey aey aey I was drunk an all the time
Aey aey aey aey I was drunk an all the time
