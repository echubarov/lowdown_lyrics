M. Night

I know you and we happy in ocean
You know you write in my mind happy amotion
And always be in the sea suppuration
My chemic time in my lie for passion

Ohh that is why
And something when I die 
Nothing will to say goodbye
But I know the not try

Ohh that is why
And something when I die 
Nothing will to say goodbye
But I know the not try, I try

Close that door seating floor and don’t look back
All your dream is not free this is fact
Pain inside this is right from your quiet
Run from trees you will see on your track
